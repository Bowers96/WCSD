## Approach
The first day of the project I spent on planning.:
- writing user stories
- designing wireframes
- developing ERD
- defining my work processes

After I got all the planning out of the way I began to work and develop my idea. I started develping the front-end and styled it to what I wanted and then I created my back-end. I went on to deploying it to Heroku. I then deployed my app to GitHub pages so it was all deployed on the internet.

I finished everything up with my README.md's. Once I finished those I did a lot of debugging test to make sure everything was working correctly, I went on to asking my classmates to try and break my app and give me any feedback on it.


## Future Enhancements
- Adding Stripe
